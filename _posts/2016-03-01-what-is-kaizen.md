The Bitmask application is lovingly hand-crafted by a team of paid and volunteer programmers from seven different countries. Development is principally sponsored by the LEAP Encryption Access Project, an non-profit organization dedicated to defending democracy by protecting the right to whisper.

The service providers demo.bitmask.net and mail.bitmask.net are operated by LEAP in order to demonstrate usage of the Bitmask application. However, we actively encourage other organizations to start their own compatible service providers by using our free software platform for server automation.
